Types of flights : We have 3 types of flights. first one is Direct flight, in which the aircraft takes off from origin and lands on the destination airport without any stoppage. 
Second is Connecting flight where the passenger changes either aircraft or terminal or the airport after taking off from origin airport and before reaching to the destination airport.

Third is VIA flight. It is also called Transit flight. Where Passenger boards to the flight at origin or source airport and deboards or deplanes at the destination airport. But the aircraft has one or more stoppage between origin and destination. The reason of stoppage could be fuel refillment or passenger deboarding and onboarding.
