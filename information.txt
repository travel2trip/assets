TRAVEL CERTIFICATE

✈️ What Is an Air India Express Travel Certificate

A travel certificate is an official proof of travel document that the airline issues showing that you actually completed a flight journey with them. This certificate is often used for:

Reimbursement from your employer (e.g., LTC/LTA travel claims).

Tax documentation or accounting purposes.

Corporate or official duty claims where proof of travel is required.

Records when you’ve lost your boarding pass or other travel receipts.

It is not a visa, passport, or travel permit — it simply certifies that you took a flight booked and flown with Air India Express.

📄 Key Details about the Certificate

You typically need to provide your ticket/PNR details to generate it.

The airline will charge a fee, it’s usually ₹300 per passenger per PNR.

The certificate shows basic details like passenger name, flight date, and itinerary — enough for many official reimbursement or record-keeping needs. One such information is if the passenger boarded the flight or not.

🧾 How It’s Used

People request a travel certificate when:

Their boarding pass was misplaced (since airlines only keep boarding pass info for a limited time).

They need official documentation for employer claims (like LTC/LTA reimbursements in India).

They want a formal travel record beyond the typical e-ticket/itin confirmation.

📥 How to Get It

Air India Express allows passengers to generate or download a travel certificate online through their official site by entering travel details and paying the fee.
